# IMPACT-OF-ECONOMIC-FREEDOM-PARAMETERS-ON-LIBERAL-DEMOCRACY
Since the work of Friedrich A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom, both political scientists and economists have been puzzled 
about the link between democracy and economic freedom. It is important to understand the association between 
democracy and economic freedom because democracy is a multifaceted and complex system that is not simply a 
political system â€“ it is an economic system too.


So historically whenever the relation between economic freedom and democracy is studied, one hypothesis that often 
comes into picture is the Hayek- Lipset -Freidman hypothesis. It also the prime hypothesis that we wanted to test 
through our model.
