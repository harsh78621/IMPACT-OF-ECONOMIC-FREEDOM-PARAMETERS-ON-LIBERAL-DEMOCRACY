# IMPACT-OF-ECONOMIC-FREEDOM-PARAMETERS-ON-LIBERAL-DEMOCRACY
Since the work of Friedrich A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom, both political scientists and economists have been puzzled 
about the link between democracy and economic freedom. It is important to understand the association between 
democracy and economic freedom because democracy is a multifaceted and complex system that is not simply a 
political system – it is an economic system too.


So historically whenever the relation between economic freedom and democracy is studied, one hypothesis that often 
comes into picture is the Hayek- Lipset -Freidman hypothesis. It also the prime hypothesis that we wanted to test 
through our model.

Objective: The objective of this project is to find to what extent economic freedom parameters have an impact on 
the dependent variable “Liberal Democracy Index” of different countries.

Selection of Dependent and Independent Variables:

1. Dependent Variable(Liberal Democracy Index):
   
The variable denotes the best estimate of the extent of suffrage, the freedom and fairness of elections, 
freedoms of association and expression, individual and minority rights, equality before the law, and 
executive constraints.

2. Independent Variable:
   
All the ratings in the index, these are values out of 10; 10 is the highest possible rating and zero (0) is the 
lowest. A higher rating indicates a greater degree of economic freedom.

i. Size of Government: 

Government spending, taxation, and the size of government-controlled enterprises increases, 
government decision making is substituted for individual choice and economic freedom is reduced. 

ii. Sound Money 

Inflation erodes the value of rightfully earned wages and savings. Sound money is thus essential to 
protect property rights. when inflation is not only high but also volatile, it becomes difficult for 
individuals to plan for the future and thus use economic freedom effectively .

iii. Freedom to Trade Internationally

Freedom to exchange- in its broadest sense, buying, selling, making contracts, and so on- is essential 
to economic freedom, which is reduced when freedom to exchange does not include businesses and 
individuals in other nations.

iv. Regulation

Governments not only use a number of tools to limit the right to exchange internationally they may 
also impose onerous regulations that limit the right to exchange, gain credit, higher or work for 
whom you wish or freely operate your business.

v. Legal system and Property Rights:

Protection of person and their rightfully acquired property is a central element of both economic 
freedom and civil society. Indeed, it is the most important function of government.

CONSCLUSION:

• A positive coefficient for "Legal System & Property Rights" suggest that when the legal 
system and property rights are stronger or more protective of individual rights and property, it 
tends to contribute positively to a country's liberal democracy index. This means that 
improvements in legal systems and property rights are associated with higher levels of liberal 
democracy.

• A positive coefficient for the "Size of Government" variable suggests that a higher value SoG 
keeping other variable constant is that the government has lesser control of enterprises 
owned by individual, the individual choice is not overshadowed by the government decision. 
Thus, improving level of liberal democracy.

• Sound Money and Freedom to Trade Internationally is not a significant parameter for Liberal 
Democracy Index.

• Finally, we can conclude from our regression line is that, for a sustainable civil society a 
proper balance among Legal System & Property Rights, Regulation and Size of Government is 
seems to be necessary.

• Economic parameters can determine liberal democracy index up to 58.7%
